Write a concise git commit message for the changes.
Commit only the current changes in the working tree. After committing, ensure `git status` is clean.
Format:
<type>: <summary>

Rules:
- Use imperative mood.
- Keep summary under 72 characters.
- Pick a sensible type (feat, fix, chore, refactor, test, docs).
